# Accessibility (NFR-005)

Goal: Keyboard, screen readers, contrast. DoD: No critical axe violations on core screens.

## What changed

- ARIA and semantics:
  - Vote cards expose `role="list"` / `role="listitem"`, `aria-pressed`, `aria-disabled`, and meaningful `aria-label`s.
  - Reconnect banner and progress pills use `role="status"` with `aria-live="polite"`.
  - Join modal is labelled/described with `aria-labelledby`/`aria-describedby`.

- Focus management:
  - New `appUiFocusTrap` directive traps Tab focus within modals and restores focus on close.
  - Join modal autofocuses the name input when shown.
  - Escape closes the join modal (existing HostListener).

- Contrast:
  - Replaced low‐contrast `text-slate-500` usages with `text-slate-600`.
  - Harmonized focus/selected styling for vote cards to the primary palette (≥ 4.5:1).

## Tests

- Unit tests for focus trap cycling and containment.
- Contrast token tests ensure key text colors (primary-900, slate-700/600 on white) meet 4.5:1.
- `jest-axe` checks for serious/critical violations on Lobby and VoteCards.

Run: `npm run test` or `npx nx test web`.

## Usage

- Apply `appUiFocusTrap` to any dialog/modal container to enforce focus trapping.
- Prefer `text-slate-600`+ for small body text on light backgrounds.
