# NFR-011 Split Shared Types

Status: Done

Summary
- Split the monolithic `shared-types.ts` into focused files to improve maintainability and discoverability.

Scope
- Library: `apps/shared-types`
- Affected apps: `api`, `web` (consuming types via package entrypoint)

Changes
- Introduced modular files under `src/lib/`:
  - `domain.ts` – `Role`, `Participant`, `DeckId`, `VoteStats`, `Room`
  - `rest-contracts.ts` – `CreateRoomRequest`, `CreateRoomResponse`
  - `ws-contracts.ts` – WebSocket payloads and events
- Updated `src/index.ts` to re-export from the new modules.
- Removed `src/lib/shared-types.ts`.

Tests
- Added Jest setup and a sanity spec (`public-api.spec.ts`) ensuring types are accessible from the package public API and compile in consumer code.

Validation
- Lint, unit tests, and builds run for all projects to ensure no regressions.

Notes
- Public API remains unchanged; consumers continue importing from `@scrum-poker/shared-types`.
