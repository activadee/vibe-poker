### Epic: Rooms & Presence | **Goal**: Presence and leave/disconnect handling | **Refs**: FR-003

- **Story**: As a participant I see who is present; when someone leaves/disconnects, the list updates automatically. | **Estimate**: 3
  - **AC**:
    - On socket disconnect, participant is removed and state is broadcast.
    - Manual "Leave Room" removes participant and navigates back to Lobby.
  - **Tasks**:
    - [BE] Disconnect handler → remove participant → emit `room:state` — 2
    - [FE] Leave action in UI (secondary) + route to `/` — 1
    - [QA] Simulate disconnect; assert participant disappears — 1
  - **Dependencies**: FR‑002
  - **DoD**:
    - No orphan participants remain after disconnect; memory is reclaimed.
