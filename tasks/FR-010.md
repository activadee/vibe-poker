### Epic: Voting | **Goal**: Reset votes | **Refs**: FR-010
- **Story**: As a host I can reset the voting round to start over. | **Estimate**: 3
  - **AC**:
    - `vote:reset` clears votes and `hasVoted` flags; state returns to hidden.
  - **Tasks**:
    - [BE] RoomsService.reset + gateway event — 1
    - [FE] Host‑only Reset action + confirmation — 1
    - [QA] E2E: reveal → reset → progress 0/Y — 1
  - **Dependencies**: FR‑004, FR‑008, FR‑009
  - **DoD**:
    - All clients reflect reset within 250 ms P95.

Implementation (FR-010)

- Backend
  - Added `RoomsService.reset(roomId)` that clears `votes`, sets `revealed = false`, and removes any `stats` from previous rounds. Returns the updated room.
  - Updated WebSocket gateway handler for `vote:reset` to delegate to `RoomsService.reset` and broadcast both `room:state` (sanitized while hidden) and `vote:progress`.
  - Unit test added to `apps/api/src/app/rooms/rooms.service.spec.ts` verifying that reset clears votes, hides reveal, removes stats, and sets progress to `0/Y` (eligible voters).

- Frontend
  - Host-only Reset button already existed in Room view; added a confirmation prompt before emitting `vote:reset` to prevent accidental resets.
  - UI derives `hasVoted` from the `vote:progress` event; after reset, badges clear immediately and progress shows `0/Y`.

- How to verify
  1) Start both apps: `nx serve api` (in one terminal) and `nx serve web` (in another).
  2) Create a room and join from multiple browsers/tabs; cast votes as players.
  3) As host, click Reveal — values and stats display.
  4) Click Reset and confirm — values hide, badges clear, and progress updates to `0/Y` within one tick.

- Tests and lint
  - Run unit tests: `nx run-many -t test`.
  - Lint Angular app: `nx run web:lint`.
  - Build apps to ensure type-safety: `nx run-many -t build`.
