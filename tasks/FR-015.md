### Epic: Lifecycle | **Goal**: Room TTL cleanup | **Refs**: FR-015
- **Story**: As a maintainer I need rooms to expire automatically after 24h to limit memory. | **Estimate**: 3
  - **AC**:
    - Background sweeper removes expired rooms; joining an expired room yields “expired” error.
  - **Tasks**:
    - [BE] Interval sweeper + graceful deletion — 2
    - [QA] Unit test TTL logic; simulate expiry — 1
  - **Dependencies**: FR‑001
  - **DoD**:
    - Memory footprint remains bounded under churn.

Status: Done

Changes:
- Added background TTL sweeper to remove expired rooms periodically:
  - Service: `apps/api/src/app/rooms/ttl-sweeper.service.ts` (runs every 60s, logs removals)
  - Wired in module: `apps/api/src/app/rooms/rooms.module.ts`
- Enforced join-time expiry handling with explicit error:
  - Gateway now rejects joins to expired rooms with `{ code: 'expired' }` and removes the room eagerly for cleanup (`apps/api/src/app/rooms/rooms.gateway.ts`).
- Shared contract updated to include new error code:
  - `apps/shared-types/src/lib/ws-contracts.ts` (`RoomErrorEvent` now includes `'expired'`).

Tests:
- Service TTL logic: `apps/api/src/app/rooms/rooms.service.spec.ts` already covers `removeExpired()`; kept as-is.
- Added sweeper unit test using fake timers:
  - `apps/api/src/app/rooms/ttl-sweeper.service.spec.ts` validates periodic calls and cleanup.
- Added join-expired test:
  - `apps/api/src/app/rooms/rooms.gateway.spec.ts` checks emitted `{ code: 'expired' }` and no join occurs.

Validation:
- All tests pass: `nx run-many -t test --all`
- Lint clean (no errors): `nx run-many -t eslint:lint --all`

Notes:
- Join path deletes the expired room immediately and signals the client with a clear, actionable message to create a new room.
