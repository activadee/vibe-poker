### Epic: Lobby & Routing | **Goal**: Deep‑link join | **Refs**: FR-012
- **Story**: As a user, opening `/r/:roomId` routes me into the join flow quickly. | **Estimate**: 2
  - **AC**:
    - If no name known, show name prompt modal; on submit, call join.
    - Invalid room shows error + create‑new CTA.
  - **Tasks**:
    - [FE] Router guard + param extraction — 1
    - [QA] Deep‑link tests for valid/invalid rooms — 1
  - **Dependencies**: FR‑002
  - **DoD**:
    - Copying/sharing the URL is sufficient for teammates to join.
