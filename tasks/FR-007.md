### Epic: Decks | **Goal**: Standard Fibonacci deck preset | **Refs**: FR-007
- **Story**: As a player I can pick from the standard deck (1,2,3,5,8,13,21,?, ☕). | **Estimate**: 2
  - **AC**:
    - Deck rendered as cards; click selects value; selection is visible locally.
  - **Tasks**:
    - [FE] VoteCards component with preset values — 1 ✅ Done
    - [QA] UI test: all cards present and clickable — 1 ✅ Done
  - **Dependencies**: None
  - **DoD**:
    - Cards are accessible via keyboard and have focus styles.

Implementation Notes (Done):
- New standalone component `VoteCardsComponent` renders the standard Fibonacci preset: `['1','2','3','5','8','13','21','?','☕']`.
- Keyboard support: Arrow keys move focus; Enter/Space selects; Home/End jump to first/last. Visible focus ring provided.
- Accessibility: Cards are real buttons, `aria-pressed` reflects local selection; `☕` has label “Coffee break”.
- Room UI integration: Replaced inline deck with `<app-vote-cards>`; selection emits `(valueSelected)` which triggers existing `castVote()`.
- Observers cannot vote: component respects a `[disabled]` input and shows a helper hint.
- Code quality: removed `any` from `RoomComponent` (properly types deckId assignment).

How to Test:
- Unit test added at `apps/web/src/app/vote-cards/vote-cards.component.spec.ts`:
  - Verifies all cards render in order and are clickable.
  - Confirms selection state (`aria-pressed`, `.selected`) and event emission.
  - Exercises keyboard navigation and selection.
  - Ensures disabled state blocks selection.
- Run: `nx test web` and `nx lint web` — both pass with no lint errors.
