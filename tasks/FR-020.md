### Epic: Share & Join | Goal: Role-aware invite text | Refs: FR-020

- Story: As a host I want the “Copy Link” button to copy an invite message that includes separate links to join as a user or as an observer. | Estimate: 2

Acceptance Criteria
- Lobby navigation to a room always includes an explicit role query param (`?role=player|observer`).
- Room route reads `?role=observer` to preselect the observer option on the join form.
- The room’s Share area keeps the single visible link and “Copy Link” button.
- Clicking “Copy Link” copies a multi-line text to the clipboard:
  - `Join this room:`
  - `Join as observer: <origin>/r/<roomId>?role=observer`
  - `Join as user: <origin>/r/<roomId>?role=player`

Implementation Notes
- FE (web):
  - `LobbyComponent.joinRoom()` now always navigates with `queryParams: { role: 'player' | 'observer' }`.
  - `RoomComponent` reads the role param to preselect observer and provides helpers to build both links; `copyLink()` writes the formatted invite.

QA
- From lobby, join a room as user and observer; the URL should include a `role` param.
- In a room, click “Copy Link”, then paste; the text includes both links with correct room id and origin.
