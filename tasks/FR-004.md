### Epic: Roles | **Goal**: Host/Player/Observer roles with permissions | **Refs**: FR-004, FR-013
- **Story**: As a host I can reveal/reset and manage deck/story; players can vote; observers cannot vote. | **Estimate**: 5
  - **AC**:
    - Host: can `vote:reveal`, `vote:reset`, `story:set`, `deck:set`.
    - Player: can `vote:cast` only.
    - Observer: cannot `vote:cast`; UI disables cards.
  - **Tasks**:
    - [BE] Role model; permission checks in gateway — 2
    - [FE] Role‑aware UI controls (enable/disable) — 2
    - [QA] Negative tests: observer cannot vote; non‑host cannot reveal — 1
  - **Dependencies**: FR‑001, FR‑002
  - **DoD**:
    - Authorization attempts are logged; unauthorized actions are safely ignored.
