### Epic: Quality | Goal: Type safety (no `any` in non-test code) | Refs: NFR-012

- Story: As a maintainer I want production/source code to avoid `any` so the type system catches regressions.
- AC:
  - No usages of `any` in non-test files for this repo scope.
  - Lint passes without errors related to `any` in source code.
- Changes:
  - api: rooms.gateway.ts — removed `as any` casts; use direct property access, safe destructuring without `any`.
  - api: rooms.service.ts — replaced `delete (room as any).stats` with `delete room.stats`.
  - web: room.component.ts — removed `payload: any`; typed with `RoomJoinPayload` and static type-only import.
- Notes:
  - Test files still use `any` for test doubles; that’s acceptable per test guidelines.
- Validation:
  - Tests: `npx nx run-many -t test -p web,api,shared-types` — all green.
  - Lint: `npx nx run-many -t eslint:lint -p web,api,shared-types` — no errors; warnings remain only in spec files.
  - Build: `npx nx build web && npx nx build api` — successful.
