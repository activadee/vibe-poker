### Epic: Rooms & Presence | **Goal**: Create an ephemeral room | **Refs**: FR-001, NFR-003, NFR-007, NFR-010
- **Story**: As a facilitator I can create a room and get a shareable link so my team can join. | **Refs**: FR-001 | **Estimate**: 5
  - **AC**:
    - When I click “Create Room” after entering my display name, a room is created and I am assigned as **host**.
    - I’m routed to `/r/:roomId` and can copy a share link.
    - Room has a TTL of 24h and no data persists beyond TTL (in‑memory only).
  - **Tasks**:
    - [BE] NestJS `POST /rooms` controller + service to create `Room` — 2
    - [BE] Generate human‑readable id (e.g., `ABCD-1234`) + collision guard — 1
    - [BE] TTL metadata & sweeper skeleton (see FR‑015) — 1
    - [FE] Lobby form (name) + Create Room CTA + route to `/r/:roomId` — 2
    - [QA] Unit test RoomsService.create + E2E create→redirect — 2
  - **Dependencies**: NFR‑003, NFR‑007, NFR‑010
  - **DoD**:
    - Unit & E2E pass; link works in fresh browser; logs include room_id on create.
