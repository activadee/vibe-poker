### Epic: Voting | **Goal**: Reveal and statistics (avg/median) | **Refs**: FR-009
- **Story**: As a host I can reveal all votes and see average and median to guide discussion. | **Estimate**: 5
  - **AC**:
    - `vote:reveal` publishes individual votes; average shown to 1 decimal; median based on numeric cards only.
    - Non‑numeric cards (e.g., '?', '☕') are excluded from numeric stats but are displayed.
  - **Tasks**:
    - [BE] Reveal state flag + stats functions (avg/median) — 2
    - [BE] Gateway `vote:reveal` event — 1
    - [FE] Results row + stats pill — 1
    - [QA] Stats correctness tests (odd/even counts, non‑numeric present) — 2
  - **Dependencies**: FR‑008
  - **DoD**:
    - Stats match server calculation; UI stays consistent on refresh.
