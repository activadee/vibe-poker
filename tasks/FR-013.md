### Epic: Roles | **Goal**: Observer restrictions | **Refs**: FR-013
- **Story**: As an observer I cannot cast votes but can watch progress and results. | **Estimate**: 2
  - **AC**:
    - Vote buttons disabled; tooltip explains observer role.
  - **Tasks**:
    - [FE] Disable vote controls for observers — 1
    - [QA] Attempted vote ignored; UI feedback OK — 1
  - **Dependencies**: FR‑004, FR‑008
  - **DoD**:
    - No server‑side state change from observer attempts.

Implementation Notes
- Web: `RoomComponent` offers a checkbox to “Join as observer (cannot vote)”. If checked, it sends `room:join` with `{ role: 'observer' }`.
- Web: `RoomComponent` passes `[disabled]="myRole() === 'observer'"` to `app-vote-cards`; `castVote` no-ops for observers.
- Web: `VoteCardsComponent` disables buttons and shows a tooltip and hint when disabled.
  - Buttons include `title="Observers cannot vote"` and `aria-disabled="true"` when disabled.
  - A live region hint displays “Observers cannot vote”.
- API: `RoomsGateway` rejects `vote:cast` from non-players with a `forbidden` error and does not mutate state.
  - API: `RoomsGateway.handleJoin` now honors `payload.role === 'observer'` (host still elevated by placeholder name, player is default).

Tests
- Frontend unit tests
  - `apps/web/src/app/vote-cards/vote-cards.component.spec.ts`
    - Verifies disabled state shows tooltip and hint; clicks do not emit.
  - `apps/web/src/app/room/room.component.spec.ts`
    - Verifies that when the current user’s role is `observer`, vote cards are disabled and `castVote` does not emit `vote:cast`.
- Backend unit tests (pre-existing)
  - `apps/api/src/app/rooms/rooms.gateway.spec.ts` includes “observer cannot cast vote”.

QA Checklist
- Join a room as a player and as an observer in two windows.
- As observer:
  - Hover a vote card to see the tooltip “Observers cannot vote”.
  - Cards are disabled; clicking does nothing.
  - Progress updates in real time as the player votes; reveal displays results.
- Confirm no server-side vote is recorded from observer attempts (no progress increase).

How to Join as Observer
- From the landing page:
  - Enter the room code/link and check “Join as observer (cannot vote)”, then click “Join Room”.
- From a room link directly:
  - Join screen shows your saved name (if any) and the observer checkbox. Check it before clicking “Join Room”.
  - You can also append `?role=observer` to the room URL to preselect observer.

Notes
- Auto-join with saved displayName is disabled to allow selecting observer before joining.

Status
- FE controls disabled with tooltip: Done
- BE ignores observer votes: Done (verified by tests)
