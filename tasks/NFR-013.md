### Epic: Quality | Goal: Replace deprecated Angular structural directives with new control flow | Refs: NFR-013

- Story: As a maintainer I want to migrate deprecated template directives (e.g. `*ngIf`, `*ngFor`, `ng-template`) to Angular’s new built-in control flow (`@if`, `@else`, `@for`) so templates are future-proof and consistent.

- AC:
  - No usage of deprecated structural directives remains in the `web` app templates where new control flow is applicable.
  - Behavior is unchanged: conditional blocks and loops render exactly as before.
  - Tests cover key migrated conditions.

- Changes:
  - web: lobby/lobby.component.html — `*ngIf="error()"` replaced with `@if (error()) { … }`.
  - web: room/room.component.html —
    - Progress pill: `*ngIf="voteTotal() > 0"` → `@if (voteTotal() > 0) { … }`.
    - Voted badge: `*ngIf="hasVoted(p)"` → `@if (hasVoted(p)) { … }`.
    - Vote display: `*ngIf="revealed(); else …"` + `ng-template` → `@if (revealed()) { … } @else { … }`.
    - Removed unnecessary `ng-container` wrappers inside new `@if` blocks.

- Tests:
  - web: lobby/lobby.component.spec.ts — added assertion that the error alert renders when `error()` is set.
  - web: room/room.component.spec.ts — added tests for:
    - Progress pill visibility when votes exist.
    - Vote placeholder before reveal and actual value after reveal.

- Notes:
  - Non-test TypeScript continues to avoid `any` types per NFR-012.
  - Existing tests already validate several `@if` guarded sections (join modal, host controls); new tests extend coverage to migrated areas.

- Validation:
  - Lint: `npx nx run web:lint` — no errors (warnings only in spec files are acceptable).
  - Tests: `npx nx run web:test --passWithNoTests=false` — all passing.
  - Build: `npx nx run web:build` — successful.
