### Epic: Room UI | **Goal**: Participant list and vote progress | **Refs**: FR-006
- **Story**: As a participant I can see who has voted (not the values) until reveal. | **Estimate**: 3
  - **AC**:
    - Each participant shows name + badge “voted” once submitted.
    - Progress indicator shows X/Y voted.
  - **Tasks**:
    - [FE] Participant list component + “has voted” badges — 2
    - [FE] Progress bar/pill bound to `vote:progress` — 1
    - [QA] Progress updates with multiple clients — 1
  - **Dependencies**: FR‑002, FR‑008
  - **DoD**:
    - No values leaked prior to reveal; refresh restores state.

Implementation Notes (Done):
- Added a new WebSocket event `vote:progress` carrying only aggregate progress and anonymized voter ids: `{ count, total, votedIds }`.
- Server now emits `vote:progress` on join/leave, vote cast, reveal, reset, and deck change. Votes are never sent before reveal.
- Server `room:state` is sanitized to omit `votes` until `revealed === true` to prevent leakage.
- Web UI updates:
  - Participant list shows a “Voted” pill beside participants who have voted (hidden after reveal).
  - A compact progress pill displays `X/Y voted` above the list.

How to Test:
- Open two browser windows to the same room. Join with different names and roles (one observer, one player/host).
- Cast votes from one window; observe “Voted” badge appears for that participant in both windows, and progress updates in real time.
- Verify observers do not affect totals and cannot vote.
- Click Reveal as host — values display; badges are hidden; progress remains accurate.
- Click Reset — progress resets to 0/Y, values hidden again.

Non‑Goals / Safety:
- The server never sends actual vote values until reveal, including during joins. This ensures “no values leaked prior to reveal.”
