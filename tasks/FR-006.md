### Epic: Room UI | **Goal**: Participant list and vote progress | **Refs**: FR-006
- **Story**: As a participant I can see who has voted (not the values) until reveal. | **Estimate**: 3
  - **AC**:
    - Each participant shows name + badge “voted” once submitted.
    - Progress indicator shows X/Y voted.
  - **Tasks**:
    - [FE] Participant list component + “has voted” badges — 2
    - [FE] Progress bar/pill bound to `vote:progress` — 1
    - [QA] Progress updates with multiple clients — 1
  - **Dependencies**: FR‑002, FR‑008
  - **DoD**:
    - No values leaked prior to reveal; refresh restores state.
