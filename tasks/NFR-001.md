### Epic: Reliability | **Goal**: Availability & graceful degradation | **Refs**: NFR-001
- **Story**: As a user I experience stable behavior even if the server restarts. | **Estimate**: 3
  - **AC**:
    - In‑memory state is acceptable; rooms are ephemeral; restarts show clear banner if they occur.
  - **Tasks**:
    - [BE] Health endpoint `/healthz` — 1
    - [FE] Optional reconnect banner on socket reconnect — 1
    - [QA] Restart simulation script — 1
  - **Dependencies**: NFR‑007, NFR‑010
  - **DoD**:
    - Health checks green; reconnect UX verified.

---

Implementation Notes (Done):

- Backend: `/healthz` now responds both unprefixed and under the API prefix.
  - Quick check:
    - `curl -i http://localhost:3000/healthz`
    - `curl -i http://localhost:3000/api/healthz`
- Frontend: Room view shows a reconnect banner when the socket disconnects and a success banner on reconnect (auto-hides).
- QA: `tasks/restart-sim.sh` simulates an API restart locally and waits for `/healthz` to return.

How to try it locally:

1) Start dev servers: `npm run dev`
2) Open a room in the browser.
3) In another terminal, run: `bash tasks/restart-sim.sh`
4) Observe reconnect banner in the UI.
