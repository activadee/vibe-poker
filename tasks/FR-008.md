### Epic: Voting | **Goal**: Cast hidden vote | **Refs**: FR-008
- **Story**: As a player I can cast a vote which remains hidden until reveal. | **Estimate**: 5
  - **AC**:
    - `vote:cast` stores value by participant; re‑casting overwrites previous value.
    - `vote:progress` broadcasts counts only, not values.
  - **Tasks**:
    - [BE] RoomsService.castVote + progress calc — 2
    - [BE] Gateway `vote:cast` + validations — 1
    - [FE] Emit on card click + local selected state — 1
    - [QA] Multi‑client test: hidden until reveal — 1
  - **Dependencies**: FR‑002, FR‑007, NFR‑003
  - **DoD**:
    - No value appears in network logs before reveal (except on server).
