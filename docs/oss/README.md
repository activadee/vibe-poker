# OSS Readiness

This project is set up to be community‑friendly and contributor‑ready.

Maintenance tips:

- Keep `README.md` badges and "Getting Started" accurate.
- Update the architecture docs in `docs/` and each app's `docs/` folder as the code evolves.
- CI workflow in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs `lint`, `test` and `build` for all projects.
